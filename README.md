# 🏭 Nassau Candy Product Line Profitability Dashboard
An interactive data analytics dashboard to evaluate product profitability, margin performance, and cost efficiency for a candy distribution business.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes product-level profitability and margin performance for a candy distribution business. The objective is to move beyond sales-based evaluation and identify products that truly drive profit.

The solution is implemented as an interactive Streamlit dashboard, enabling users to explore revenue, cost, and margin relationships across products and divisions for better business decision-making.

## 🎯 Business Problem

In many businesses, high sales are often mistaken for strong performance. However, certain products generate high revenue but contribute low profit due to high production or operational costs.

This project addresses the following:

* Which products generate the highest profit and margin?
* Are high-sales products actually profitable?
* How profitability varies across different divisions?
* Which products carry margin risk due to high cost?
